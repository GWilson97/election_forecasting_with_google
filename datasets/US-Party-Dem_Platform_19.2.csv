2000,11357,19,1900,19,1900,Now it is time to apply this lesson to the new global challenges we face - to shape a new strategy of Forward Engagement to guide our conduct around the world.,1,31
2000,11358,19,1900,19,1900,"Forward Engagement means addressing problems early in their development before they become crises, addressing them as close to the source of the problem as possible, and having the forces and resources to deal with these threats as soon after their emergence as possible.",1,43
2000,11359,19,1900,19,1900,"While we must always stand prepared to use our military power when all other options fail, Forward Engagement also means addressing societal and political problems before they evolve into threats to our national security and values - before armed conflict becomes the only way to achieve our goals.",1,48
2000,11360,19,1900,19,1900,"And Forward Engagement means drawing on all three main sources of American power - military strength, a vibrant, growing economy, and a free and democratic political system - to advance our objectives around the world.",1,35

2000,11364,19,1900,19,1900,"That means we must deepen our key alliances, develop more constructive relationships with former enemies, and bring together diverse coalitions of nations to deal with new problems.",1,27
2000,11365,19,1900,19,1900,America has a responsibility to lead - and should lead from within the international community.,1,15

2000,11374,19,1900,19,1900,It means investing in building the global peace.,1,8
2000,11375,19,1905,19,1905,"It means addressing the fact that more than 1 billion of the Earth's inhabitants live on less than $1 a day - inviting social dislocation, violence, and war.",1,28
2000,11376,19,1900,19,1900,"It means meeting new challenges such as international crime and terrorism, environmental degradation, and pandemic diseases head-on.",1,17
2000,11377,19,1900,19,1900,And it means that Forward Engagement must be the new pole-star of our global strategy.,1,15
2000,11378,19,1900,19,1900,The questions of war and peace among sovereign states are as important to our security as ever.,1,17
2000,11379,19,1900,19,1900,But today America also faces a new set of international issues.,1,11
2000,11380,19,1900,19,1900,"Technology's unprecedented power means that lawlessness, diseases, and ecological disruptions - which once were localized - now land on America's doorstep even as they also threaten the stability and security of nations all over the world.",1,36
2000,11381,19,1902,19,1902,"The disruption of the world's ecological systems - from the rise of global warming and the consequent damage to our climate balance, to the loss of living species and the depletion of ocean fisheries and forest habitats - continues at a frightening rate.",1,43
2000,11382,19,1902,19,1902,We must act now to protect our Earth while preserving and creating jobs for our people.,1,16
2000,11383,19,1902,19,1902,"In 1997, we negotiated the historic Kyoto Protocols, an international treaty that will establish a strong, realistic, and effective framework to reduce greenhouse emissions in an environmentally strong and economically sound way.",1,32
2000,11384,19,1902,19,1902,We are working to develop a broad international effort to take action to meet this threat.,1,16
2000,11385,19,1902,19,1902,Al Gore and the Democratic Party believe we must now ratify those Protocols.,1,13

2000,11400,12,1203,12,1203,We must continue to have a strong Drug Czar who can bring together the considerable resources of the U.S. Government in this effort.,1,23
2000,11401,12,1203,12,1203,We must continue to fight those who make the financing of this effort possible such as the money launderers who facilitate the drug trade.,1,24
2000,11402,12,1203,12,1203,We must continue to work with our friends and allies and international organizations to fight the blood money of the drug trade by getting a handle on those nations who turn a blind eye to the financial end of this problem.,1,41

2004,11758,16,1619,16,1619,We cannot allow a failed state in Iraq that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists and a destabilizing force in the Middle East.,1,24

2004,11770,16,1604,16,1604,"In a Democratic Administration, that will change.",1,7
2004,11771,16,1604,16,1604,"Too many of our nation's finest troops have died in attacks, because tens of thousands were deployed to Iraq without the best bulletproof vests, and there is a shortage of armored vehicles on the ground.",1,35

2004,11780,16,1602,16,1602,We must convince NATO to take on a more significant role and contribute additional military forces.,1,16
2004,11781,16,1619,16,1619,"As other countries, including Muslim majority countries, contribute troops, the United States will be able to reduce its military presence in Iraq, and we intend to do this when appropriate so that the military support needed by a sovereign Iraqi government will no longer be seen as the direct continuation of an American military presence.",1,55

2004,11789,19,1921,19,1921,And they need to be able to communicate their concerns to international authorities without feeling they are being disrespected in their own country.,1,23
2004,11790,19,1921,19,1921,America also needs a massive training effort to build Iraqi security forces that can actually provide security for the Iraqi people.,1,21
2004,11791,19,1921,19,1921,It must be done in the field and on the job as well as in the classroom.,1,17
